# CapstoneApp
Use Android Studio's Import tab to create the project from a folder or use its Version Control tab to import directly from GitHub 
(although I have ran into problems using this option). To run the app, use an android device or download an emulator using Android Studio's emulation manager. The device's sdk must be 23 or higher and it must be able to run google play as it is needed for google maps. The app will also require access to the device's location and have internet access, if this is not allowed the app will close and be unable to run until that the app can access the user's location.
